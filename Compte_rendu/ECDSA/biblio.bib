    abstract = {Public-key cryptographic systems often involve raising elements of some group (e.g.,GF(2n),Z/NZ, or elliptic curves) to large powers. An important question is how fast this exponentiation can be done, which often determines whether a given system is practical. The best method for exponentiation depends strongly on the group being used, the hardware the system is implemented on, and whether one element is being raised repeatedly to different powers, different elements are raised to a fixed power, or both powers and group elements vary. This problem has received much attention, but the results are scattered through the literature. In this paper we survey the known methods for fast exponentiation, examining their relative strengths and weaknesses.}

    abstract="The lll algorithm is a polynomial-time algorithm for reducing d-dimensional lattice with exponential approximation factor. Currently, the most efficient variant of lll, by Neumaier and Stehl{\'e}, has a theoretical running time in {\$}{\$}d^4{\backslash}cdot B^{\{}1+o{\backslash}left( 1{\backslash}right) {\}}{\$}{\$}d4{\textperiodcentered}B1+o1where B is the bitlength of the entries, but has never been implemented. This work introduces new asymptotically fast, parallel, yet heuristic, reduction algorithms with their optimized implementations. Our algorithms are recursive and fully exploit fast matrix multiplication. We experimentally demonstrate that by carefully controlling the floating-point precision during the recursion steps, we can reduce euclidean lattices of rank d in time {\$}{\$}{\backslash}tilde{\{}O{\}}(d^{\backslash}omega {\backslash}cdot C){\$}{\$}O{\textasciitilde}(d$\omega${\textperiodcentered}C), i.e., almost a constant number of matrix multiplications, where {\$}{\$}{\backslash}omega {\$}{\$}$\omega$is the exponent of matrix multiplication and C is the log of the condition number of the matrix. For cryptographic applications, C is close to B, while it can be up to d times larger in the worst case. It improves the running-time of the state-of-the-art implementation fplll by a multiplicative factor of order {\$}{\$}d^2{\backslash}cdot B{\$}{\$}d2{\textperiodcentered}B. Further, we show that we can reduce structured lattices, the so-called knapsack lattices, in time {\$}{\$}{\backslash}tilde{\{}O{\}}(d^{\{}{\backslash}omega -1{\}}{\backslash}cdot C){\$}{\$}O{\textasciitilde}(d$\omega$-1{\textperiodcentered}C)with a progressive reduction strategy. Besides allowing reducing huge lattices, our implementation can break several instances of Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes based on large integers in dimension 2,230 with 4 millions of bits.",

    DOI={10.46586/tches.v2023.i2.568-586},
    abstractNote={Lattice reduction algorithms have been proved to be one of the most powerful and versatile tools in public key cryptanalysis. In this work, we primarily concentrate on lattice attacks against (EC)DSA with nonce leakage via some sidechannel analysis. Previous works relying on lattice reduction algorithms such as LLL and BKZ will finally lead to the “lattice barrier”: lattice algorithms become infeasible when only fewer nonce is known. Recently, Albrecht and Heninger introduced lattice algorithms augmented with a predicate and broke the lattice barrier (Eurocrypt 2021). We improve their work in several aspects.We first propose a more efficient predicate algorithm which aims to search for the target lattice vector in a large database. Then, we combine sieving with predicate algorithm with the “dimensions for free” and “progressive sieving” techniques to further improve the performance of our attacks. Furthermore, we give a theoretic analysis on how to choose the optimal Kannan embedding factor.As a result, our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art lattice attacks for existing records such as 3-bit nonce leakage for a 256-bit curve and 2-bit nonce leakage for a 160-bit curve in terms of running time, sample numbers and success probability. We also break the lattice records on the 384-bit curve with 3-bit nonce leakage and the 256-bit curve with 2-bit nonce leakage which are thought infeasible previously. Finally, we give the first lattice attack against ECDSA with a single-bit nonce leakage, which enables us to break a 112-bit curve with 1-bit nonce leakage in practical time.},
